# finalproject

I plan to use the theme of "Korea" for my final project;
for my first page I will use the geography of South and North Korea and create them as svg files and adjust their colors and placement through CSS.
The user can hover over the text "One Korea" to see the colors change with the use of CSS animation keyframes.
Upon hovering on the map of Korea, users will see the two Koreas split into their respective "North Korea" and "South Korea", through Javascript requestAnimationFrame.

On my second page that will focus on North Korea, users will see a North Korea flag, and upon hovering they will see many soldiers marching in sync across the page, which will be done through CSS or Javascript
Addtionally, music from North Korea will play in the background.

On the third page that will focus on South Korea, users will see a South Korea flag, and upon hovering they will see South Korean culture of fans and people dancing, which will either spin or move around upon clicking.

Finally, the navigation page will include the distinct flags of North, South, and the proposed One Korea flag as their directory, which will increase in size when hovered, and will link to their respective site.
