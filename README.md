I used the theme of Korea to tie my three drawings together into three different categories of North Korea, South Korea, and an unified One Korea.
For navigational purposes, I used the two official flags of each nation and an unofficial reunification flag to represent one Korea.
In the one Korea page, upon hovering the country svg icon, the two will split and show a picture of the South Korean and North Korean presidents holding hands in unison, done through Javascript and CSS animation.
In the North Korean page, you can hover on Kim Jong Un to see it rotate horizontally and shows a following of figures with arsenal at his beckoning, done through javascript and css.
In the South Korean page, you can hover on the four trigrams of South Korea to show aspects of South Korean culture, done through CSS and Javascript as well.
